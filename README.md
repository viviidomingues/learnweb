Several html, css, javascript, and web correlated technologies. This is my first one version controlled project. I'm using it for learn a lot of cool technologies like: 
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript 
- Other Web Development correlated technologies.

Also I'm learning about how to track my files in another version control system.
